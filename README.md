# Reviews Landing (Packaged)

This ZIP contains a ready-to-host static site.

## Structure
```
reviews-landing/
├─ index.html
└─ assets/
   ├─ css/
   │  └─ styles.css
   └─ js/
      └─ main.js
```

- `index.html` references CDN versions of GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and Lottie.
- All custom CSS is in `assets/css/styles.css`.
- All custom JS is in `assets/js/main.js` (language toggle, animations, interactions).
- Open Graph/Twitter meta tags and JSON-LD schema are included.

## How to run
Just open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with any static server (e.g., `python -m http.server`).
